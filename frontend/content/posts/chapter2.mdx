self imposed suffering
i scheduled that motherfucking test to push me to my limits

i was immersed for a couple of weeks in an environment where most of the people were living a comfortable life. as the past few weeks i got vacations and focused harder on studying and working as a concierge, putting my mind aspect of things into proof

so on a given week, i told myself that i would try to put myself through the hardest labor hire job offerings on the week and would for absolutely sure ready to dig deep (shovel)

it happened on a sunday and i took the job for the following monday, being warned by the contractor that this was a tough job

so it kinda put me thinking that i could easily fall into that trap, of feeling that iâ€™ve done enough and stuff like that
