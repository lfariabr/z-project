**TL;DR:** You don't want to do something? That is precisely why you should do it.

self imposed suffering
i scheduled that motherfucking test to push myself and test my limits

i was immersed for a couple of weeks in an environment where most of the people were living a comfortable life. as the past few weeks i got vacations and focused harder on studying and working as a concierge, putting my mind aspect of things into proof
it all went well, but it got me thinking that the environment I was in was contagious and in order to kill of that motherfucker, on a given week, i told myself that i would try to put myself through the hardest labor hire job offerings on the week and would for absolutely sure ready to dig deep (shovel)

it happened on a sunday and i took the job for the following monday, being warned by the contractor that this was a tough job before he gave me the offer.

The goal of digging holes is that you go as deep as you can until your reach to sandstone, which is yellowish in color.

I went there on monday, 01st of September, it was a beautiful home in Paddington, narrow entrance but very long quintal.

Figure 2: Picture of the house

The job? Dig holes on the yard so the builder could place aluminum tubs that he would later on fill with concrete. Very foundational job, since this is the structure that will hold the hole floor of the house, giving it the possibility to have 2+ floors up.

At the end of the day, my forearms were shattered, I could barely lift my fork and knife to eat at night or even drink some water, but the contractor said that most guys that work for him never come the next day because the job is too nasty, too brutal.
It felt like a sting to my ego. 

Who the fuck did he think I motherfucking was?! They don't know me son!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Second day of work, same old shit. Dig holes, take the rocks, argile, tiles, cimento, and other layers off the ground, put into buckets, load into carriola 1, load into carriola 2 (second floor), walk a few meters and drop into a truck.
Repeat, the whole fucking day. 
It was my birthday, but who the fucking cares?! I better be doing this than staying with my fucking feet up at the couch.

Thir day. Can I make it?
Arrive onsite once again 7h20AM, work like a motherfucker until 4PM digging ONE fucking hole. Probably got 2+ meters into that bitch and never made it to the end.

At the end of the 3 day-cicrcuit, i couldn't feel more satisfied and alive. I look at the mirror and can easily say: There goes a BAD motherfucker!!!

May that fucking thrill never leave me. And I hope you can find yours!

PS: current point of view: 04th of september, back to working as a concierge, sitting in a desk, wearing a suit. Smiling ,sharing good mornings and delvierying parcels to resident's doors.

How about you? HAVE YOU FUCKING EARNED YOUR DAY?!?!
