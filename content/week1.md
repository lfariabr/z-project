Subject: Zero Dopamine. Maximum Output.

Welcome to Week 1.
The mission is simple: cut the noise, reclaim your focus.
Each week, you’ll get one short message. No distraction, no gimmicks.

This week: 
> "Everybody comes to a point in their life when they want to quit, 
> but it's what you do at that moment that determines who you are."
— David Goggins

Action: When you hear that voice whisper 'quit', don’t negotiate. Choose discipline.

See you next week.
